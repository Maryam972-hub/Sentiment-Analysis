# Sentiment-Analysis
In this Task I have performed sentiment analysis on the IMDb Top 1000 movies dataset using movie overview descriptions. It first cleans the text (lowercasing, removing punctuation, stopwords, lemmatization), then uses TextBlob to assign a sentiment label (positive, neutral, or negative). The cleaned text is vectorized using TF-IDF, and two models. Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes are trained and evaluated. The results are compared using accuracy scores and classification reports.
